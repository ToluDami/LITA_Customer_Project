# LITA_Customer_Project

This is where I documented the second project I submitted while learning at Incubator Hub. This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. My goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancelations and renewals.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Region
- Subscription Type
- Subscription Start
- Subscription End
- Cancelled
- Revenue
- Subscription Duration

## Basic Statistics about the dataset:
- Total Number of Customers - 33787
- 3 subscription types
- 4 Regions
- Average subscription Duration of 365days
- Total Revenue - 67,540,175
